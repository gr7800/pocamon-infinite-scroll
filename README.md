# Lazy Loading with React

# Deployed Link : [https://pokemon-infinite-loading.netlify.app]

* This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of lazy loading in a list of data fetched from an external API. The app fetches data from the PokeAPI and displays the data as a grid of cards.

# Features

Lazy loading of data as the user scrolls down the page
Search functionality to filter the list of data
Responsive design using the Chakra UI library
Use of the React Lazy Load Image Component for lazy loading of images

# Installation

# Usage

To use the app, simply scroll down the page to see more data loaded. You can also use the search box to filter the list of data by name. If you reach the end of the loaded data, more data will be loaded automatically.
